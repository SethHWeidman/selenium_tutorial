## Metis student projects

Highlighted in this repo are two projects done by students in the Metis Summer 2017 Data Science bootcamp in Chicago. The first one, by Farhaan Shaikh, involved scraping a complicated, dynamic website to analyze the causes of the Hispanic-White achievement gap in high schools across Illinois.

The second, by Boying Liu, involved scraping data from both a college rankings website and a website with information about the salaries that students attending those colleges ended up getting to determine which colleges were most economically lucrative.
