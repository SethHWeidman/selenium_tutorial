# Bridging the Achievement Gap

The purpose of this project is to explore the relationship between the Hispanic-White Achievement Gap in Illinois high schools and teacher/student racial demographics.

The web-scraping for data collection was done using the python Selenium library and is stored in the notebook titled **[Web_Scraping_Methods_and_Data_collection](Web_Scraping_Methods_and_Data_collection.ipynb)**.

The most surprising result was that the correlation between the *Hispanic-White Achievement Gap* and the *Percent of hispanic teachers in the district* was not statistically significant <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=R^2&space;=&space;0.005" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?R^2&space;=&space;0.005" title="R^2 = 0.005" /></a>.

It is still a work in progress.
The code for data analysis can be found in this notebook: **[Achievement_Gap_Data_analysis](Achievement_Gap_Data_analysis.ipynb)**
